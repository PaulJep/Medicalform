    How We Use and Disclose Your Medical Information Without Your Written Permission
    We use and disclose your medical information to conduct many activities that are common in patient care
    facilities. In certain situations, which are described below in Section 3, we are required to obtain your
    written permission to use or disclose your medical information. The following are different situations in which
    we may use or disclose your medical information without your written permission.

    Treatment: We use and disclose your medical information to provide, coordinate or manage your medical treatment
    and related services. For example, a physician will use your test results to diagnose and treat your injury or
    illness. We may share medical information with providers outside Steward such as a referring physician who is
    treating you.

    Payment: We use and disclose your medical information so that we can obtain payment for health care services
    that we provide to you. For example, we may provide information about your treatment to your insurer or other
    company or program that arranges or pays for your health care, in order to obtain their prior approval and
    authorization for the treatment.

    Health Care Operations: We use and disclose your medical information to support our efforts to improve the
    quality or cost of care and for our own management and planning. For example, we may use your medical
    information to measure the performance of our staff in how they care for you. We may also share your medical
    information with our business associates with whom we have contracted to provide services, such as a billing
    company or medical transcription service.

    Other Health Care Providers: We may also share medical information with your doctor and other health care
    providers who are not part of Steward when they need it to provide Treatment to you, to obtain Payment for the

    health care professionals, or to review their actions in following the law.

    Use or Disclosure for Directory Purposes for Patients in Steward Hospitals: We may include your name, location
    in the hospital, general health condition and religious affiliation in a patient directory without receiving
    your permission unless you tell us you do not want your information in the directory. Information in the
    directory may be shared with anyone who asks for you by name or with members of the clergy; however, religious
    affiliation will only be shared with members of the clergy.

    Disclosure to Family, Friends and Other Caregivers: We may share your medical information with a family member,
    a close personal friend, or another person who you identify if we (1) first provide you with the chance to
    object to the disclosure and you do not object; (2) infer that you do not object to the disclosure; or (3)
    obtain your agreement to share your medical information with these individuals. The medical information we share
    will be limited to the information necessary for that person’s involvement with your care or payment for your
    health care. We may also use or share your medical information with an organization, such as the American Red
    Cross, assisting in a disaster relief effort, to notify (or assist in notifying) your family about your location
    and general condition. In the event you are deceased, and unless we know that you would object, we may share
    your medical information with a family member or a close personal friend that was involved with your care or
